# Compliance build progress

Keep implementation, validation and deployment states separate. Never record credentials, customer evidence or personal data here.

## C0 — baseline, decisions, rule keys (16 October 2026)

**State:** implemented and validated locally; review-ready on `codex/compliance-c0`. Not released.

### Baseline

- `main` at `1aaca20` (PR #20, owner console actions, merged and deployed). The plan's own baseline was `8f174a1`. PRs #19 and #20 since then touch only the owner console, the shared scan-cancel SQL and owner tests.
- Migrations: **29**.
- Fresh owned PostgreSQL 18.6 cluster bound to `127.0.0.1:55439`, database `cyphward_test`, built only by `backend/scripts/bootstrap_test_database.py` (29 migrations, restricted `cyphward_app` verified). No `.env`, production URL or restored snapshot was used.
- PostgreSQL modules (admission, execution, owner views, owner actions): **51 passed**.
- Full backend suite with the test database: **611 passed, 16 skipped**. Without a test database: **560 passed, 67 skipped**.
- Frontend `npm run build`: passed. `git diff --check`: passed.

### Founder decisions — proposed defaults

The founder delegated approval to the agent on 16 October 2026 ("approve on your own"). These defaults apply until the founder overrides them.

| # | Decision | Default adopted | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Plan gating | **Growth:** full Compliance page. **Starter:** readiness % and the Security measures group; the other groups are listed but locked, with an upgrade prompt. | Gating applies to reads only. Evidence rows are written for every plan so an upgrade shows history immediately. |
| D2 | File uploads | **Deferred.** C3 accepts evidence links only. | Later: private bucket, tenant-scoped signed URLs, size and type limits, retention policy. |
| D3 | Cookie browser test location | **Measure first** in C2b. Use a separate small worker if peak memory exceeds about 200 MiB. | The VPS worker has a 640 MiB limit. |
| D4 | Clause verification | **Every register entry ships `clause_verified: false`.** The UI shows "reference pending review". The founder or a partner DPCO reviews the register before any C4 pack goes to a customer. | Corrections are one-file edits to the register JSON plus a version bump. |

Three further defaults surfaced while planning C1. They follow section 0 of the plan and are recorded so they can be challenged:

| # | Decision | Default adopted |
|---|---|---|
| D5 | Readiness numerator | Only requirements with current **present** evidence count. A gap is evidence of a problem, not readiness, so it never raises the percentage. Gaps and not-assessed counts are shown beside the percentage. |
| D6 | Tool evidence and applicability | Tool evidence never produces `not_applicable`. A check omitted for a known reason (for example, no web service) yields `not_assessed` with that reason. Only an answered applicability question (C3) can remove a requirement from the denominator. |
| D7 | Requirements without an evidence source yet | Notices, consent, DPO, registration, breach, DPIA, lawful basis, rights, transfers and training stay in the denominator as `not_assessed` ("evidence collection not available yet") until C2/C3 builds their source. The C1 maximum is therefore 6 of 29 (Nuclei can show gaps only, never present). |

### Rule keys

- `backend/app/compliance/rule_keys.py`: a stable key for each of the 15 security-check titles, patterns for 2 legacy titles still stored in production (`…Expiring within N Days`, `Modern Cryptographic Protocols Active (TLSv1.3)`), and `nuclei:<template_id>` for Nuclei. Anything else is unmapped. No stored finding is renamed.
- Each rule has a `kind`:
  - `issue`: an open finding is a gap;
  - `informational`: robots.txt paths;
  - `positive`: modern TLS protocol, which is never a gap and never evidence on its own.
- Each rule also names the declared coverage check whose conclusive evaluation it needs. Nuclei has none, so no Nuclei result can show a clean outcome.
- `backend/tests/test_compliance_rule_keys.py` (11 tests) parses `security_checks.py` and fails if any title it can emit lacks a key. A temporary new detector title made the test fail, as intended; the checker was restored unchanged.
- Production data note: one stored finding titled `rls-probe` (category Security Configuration) is not a detector output. It stays unmapped, and was left untouched.

Next: C1, as planned in `C1-plan.md`.
